# find-it

Hello!

Forget all you know about mazes! 

In this new version all paths have a way out except for one. Your goal is find the only closed shape within the maze before your time is over! 

Don’t get lost!

---------------------------------------------------------------

Find It! is going to test your ability to keep your eyes sharp while looking for the only closed shape within each maze.

As you level up, mazes get bigger and you have different times to accomplish that. Every time you lose, you go back to the first level. It’s perfect pastime!

Keep track of your time, be calm and try not to get dizzy.
Challenge your friend and see who goes further!

Good luck!
